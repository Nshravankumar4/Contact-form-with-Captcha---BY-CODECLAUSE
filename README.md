# Contact-form-with-Captcha---BY-CODECLAUSE

Hello, #connections!
I'm glad to share that I have completed Task-2 of my internship as a Web Development Intern with Code Clause's CodeClause Internship Program.

This beginner-friendly tutorial is perfect for aspiring web developers who want to enhance their knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
For this task, I developed a  Contact form with Captcha using Visual Studio Code. I would appreciate it if you could take a look at my work and leave your valuable suggestions for improvement.
